# Neural-Network
A "from scratch" neural network for recognizing handwritten digits.

This project uses the [MNIST Database of Handwritten Digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

I am creating this neural network as an exercise of applying the knowledge I have gained from [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi) series of videos (created by 3Blue1Brown) that cover the basic structure and mathematics behind neural networks.

Additionally, I intend for this to be an exercise of my working knowledge of C++.

Note: This project was not completed and is not currently being worked on. Still excited for it though, so once I get some time this should change!
